# Vector-DB-Practice

###
I will be creating a vector db and QA bot with every single vector store product below. The reason for this is to generally get familar with the vector dbs and creating simple QA bots with ease using our own data. 

A lot of this work will be done by following the documentation. 

The Vector dbs I will use are:

Pinecone - https://docs.pinecone.io/

Plenty of documentation and videos but really privatised closed source. 

Weaveiate - https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart

Good to use, great documentation 

Qdrant - https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/

- Pretty solid too use got this set up in like 30 minutes

Milvus/Zilliz - https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/quick-start-1

- Didnt enjoy this, Milvus zilliz confusing which is which or if they both work. Dont plan on using this when the other options are so much better
